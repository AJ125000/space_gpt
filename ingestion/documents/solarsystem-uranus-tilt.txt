One of the most exciting observations of our solar system is the rotational movement of the ever-revolving planets. The one planet which excites astronomers and scientists the most regarding this observation is Uranus. While the axis of rotation of all other planets is tilted slightly with one of their poles inclined towards the Sun by a minor degree, let's say, 23.5° in the case of Earth, Uranus seems to be divergent. Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to orbit, with a massive tilt of 97.77 degrees! All the planets look like spinning tops as they go around the Sun, but Uranus looks more like a ball rolling in a circular pattern on its orbits.

Why such a tilt?
The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty. Still, the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation. Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from rock more enormous than the Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4 billion years ago. However, there is a prediction that a succession of punches made the gas giant tip on its side rather than a single knockout blow, as previously thought. If there were just one collision, Uranus' moons would display retrograde motion, orbiting in the opposite direction than that which astronomers observe today. Researchers said that a series of at least two minor collisions could explain the moons' motions much better than a single giant impact.
What is the consequence of such a tilt?
This tilt adds some peculiar properties to the ice giant. One such property is observed in the magnetosphere of the planet, which is quite different from our Earth. The magnetic axis is tilted 59° away from its rotational axis, and the magnetic dipole of the planet is off-centre, shifting 1/3 radii of Uranus toward its geometric south pole. Due to these unique geometric and magnetic structures, Uranus has a highly dynamic and asymmetric magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is a barrier to the solar winds, which direct along the interplanetary magnetic field(heliospheric magnetic field), i.e., from the Sun towards the planets. Usually, the patterns of magnetic field lines of most worlds are such that they allow the solar winds to slide off except in a few regions, such as at the poles in the case of Earth. However, in the case of Uranus, when the solar winds blow at the right angle to the orbital axis, the planet's magnetic field lines up with the solar wind and lets some particles flow through. This process is called 'Magnetic Reconnection.' This phenomenon is observed occasionally at the Earth's poles resulting in intensified 'auroras.' In Uranus, it was found to happen every day as the planet completes its 17.24-hour full rotation. Thus, Uranus' rapid rotational change in field strength and orientation leads to a periodic open-close-open-close scenario as it tumbles through the solar wind giving a "Switch-like" magnetosphere. This agrees with some remote observations that revealed aurora emissions from the surface of Uranus distributed at low latitude locations, which has rarely happened on other planets.

Switching on and off a variation of magnetic fields of Uranus
Extreme tilt means extreme seasons. So think about how Uranus tilt affects its seasons, in contrast to earthly seasons. Heres one difference. Earths tilt means our north and south polar regions have a midnight sun in summer and a long polar night in winter. Since Earths axis tilt is relatively tiny, those dark and bright times at Earths poles affect a small part of our planet. But the tilt of Uranus spin axis is enormous. As a result, in summer, one pole of Uranus and a large section of that poles hemisphere continuously face the sun for 21 years. Meanwhile, the other half of Uranus  the winter half  has been in darkness for 21 years. Thats a long polar night and a long midnight sun! Spring and fall on Uranus are equally bizarre. Around the equinoxes on Uranus, sunlight strikes the planets equatorial region. During those seasons, the length of a day on Uranus plays an essential role in its climate. Uranus spins on its axis about every 17 hours, 14 minutes. So its day-night cycle lasts that long. So, most of the planet has day and night every 17 hours for much of the planets spring and fall. This results in increased activity in its atmosphere during the planets spring and fall seasons. Its quite a contrast to the summer and winter seasons when half the planet is either in darkness or daylight.
