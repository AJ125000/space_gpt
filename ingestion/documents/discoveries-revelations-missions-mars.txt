In the earliest days of Mars observation, all that we knew about the planet was that it appeared to be a fiery red speck amidst the backdrop of the stars and followed a strange loop unlike any other. Humans have come a long way since then, and our knowledge about our red neighbour has substantially broadened - all of it at the cost of decades of space exploration and research involving hundreds of scientists and engineers across the world. Still, there is so much more about the red planet that we are yet to know.
In 1877, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli reported using a telescope to observe Canali, or channels, on Mars, thus leading to a lot of speculation regarding the existence of extra-terrestrial life on the planet. These speculations, fuelled by the pop culture and science fiction of the time, were able to capture the imagination of the public right up to the space age and the first Mars missions. However, Mariner missions launched in the latter half of the 20th century revealed that the Martian atmosphere was much thinner( mostly made up of carbon dioxide) than expected, and it had a negligible magnetic field. These findings dashed the hopes of many who believed that there could be intelligent life on Mars. The Mariner 9 further revealed several of the surface features of the planet, including river beds, vast canyon systems and large extinct volcanoes.
The Viking missions launched in the following years provided some crucial information about the planet, including the fact that its surface is made up of iron-rich clay, thus giving the planet its characteristic red colour. The mission also revealed that the permanent northern cap was made of water ice. Then came the ground-breaking discoveries made by the MGS spacecraft launched in 1970, which revealed features on the Martian surface that indicated the possibility of flowing water at or near the surface of the planet.
The Mars Express orbiter launched by ESA in 2003 provided evidence that Mars had a period when its surface had flowing liquid water. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity launched in the same year further affirmed the fact that Mars had water and a warmer and thicker atmosphere in the past. The MAVEN orbiter launched later in 2013 confirmed the fact that solar winds were responsible for stripping away the atmosphere of Mars over the years, which ultimately resulted in the present condition of the planet.
In 2011 NASA launched the Curiosity rover, which for the first time, drilled into the Martian rocks and revealed their composition, which consisted of Sulphur, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon, among other life-forming chemical ingredients. It also found that the radiation levels on the surface were comparable to those experienced by astronauts in the ISS.
In addition to these, there have been several other missions aimed towards increasing our knowledge about our neighbour, the Perseverance rover being the latest iteration. All these missions are symbolic of humanityÂ’s resolve to know the unknown. There are several missions planned for the coming years, the most crucial of them being the manned Mars Mission. These missions will undoubtedly be the toughest in the history of mankind as they would require a very vast and sophisticated infrastructure both on Earth and Mars for their sustainability and success. However, one thing is for sure; no matter how daunting and intimidating the task might seem, our ingenuity and curiosity will surely help us find a way through!
