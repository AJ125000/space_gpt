The eye that enabled us to look at our infant universe!
13.8 billion years. That is approximately the time light has taken to reach us from the beginning of our universe. Isnt it amazing? Can you guess which instrument gave us this approximate age?
Today is the day when one of astronomys most useful instruments was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) was launched with the Hubble Space Telescope and five crew members. The 43.5 feet long, 12-ton telescope was deployed into space on 25th April 1990 by them. Hubble could take images with great resolution and clarity as it was free from the absorptions and disturbances caused by the atmosphere. It could detect ultraviolet light that is otherwise blocked by the atmosphere.
Hubble observations have helped in finding supermassive black holes, studying the evolution of the universe, finding out that other planets are orbiting other stars, and narrowing down the age of the universe to 13.8 billion years. In 1998, two scientists used Hubble data to find that the universe is expanding unexpectedly at an increasing rate (while it was thought to be decreasing due to gravitational pulls). The reason was an unknown form of energy called Dark Energy that pushed everything apart. It formed 70% of our universe and changed our understanding completely.
The contribution that Hubble has made to advance astronomy is immense. It is one of NASAs long-lasting and most successful science missions.
