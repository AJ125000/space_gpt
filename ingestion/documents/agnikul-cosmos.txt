Agnikul Cosmos
Agnikul Cosmos is a rising startup in India's space sector which was incubated by
IIT Madras
. It made a historic leap with the successful launch of its
Agnibaan-SOrTeD
rocket on
May 30, 2024
at
7:15 am
. The recently launched Agnibaan (which means an
arrow of fire
) wasn't a fully operational rocket and achieved only sub-orbital flight of around
8 km
. It was a
Suborbital Technological Demonstrator (SOrTeD)
designed specifically to test the core technologies for the future Agnibaan launch vehicle. Some of the milestones associated with this launch are:
World's First 3D-Printed Engine:
Agnibaan is powered by a semi-cryogenic engine (
Agnilet
) and is built entirely through 3D printing. This innovative technology reduces manufacturing time and cost.
India's First Private Launchpad:
The launch took place from
Dhanush
, a mobile launchpad established by Agnikul itself.
Agnibaan
Agnibaan is a two-stage, customizable launch vehicle designed to carry a maximum payload of
100 kg
to
700 km
LEO. The total rocket has a height of 18m and a diameter of 1.3m. Agnikul can configure the rocket with a variable number of engines based on mission requirements and launch location, offering a flexible and adaptable launch solution.
The first stage of Agnibaan is powered by
7 Agnite
engines each delivering
25kN
of thrust at sea level. All of these engines are electric pump fed engines. The first stage sports a configurable engine clustering architecture.
The second stage is powered by an
Agnite vacuum optimized engine
which offers a total thrust of
25kN
. Agnibaan comes along with an optional baby stage which sits inside the payload fairing. The dimensions of the payload envelope are 2m x 1.5m and has the ability to take one or more satellites.
This successful launch isn't just a win for Agnikul Cosmos, it's a significant moment for India's space ambitions. It demonstrates the growing prowess of the domestic private sector and places India at the forefront of 3D-printed engine technology for space applications.
On this significant milestone, Srinath Ravichandran, co-founder and CEO of Agnikul Cosmos stressed importance on the hard work of the team and said, This is the culmination of 1000s of hours of reviews and hard work by the team. We are blessed to have had the opportunity and the full support of IN-SPACe and ISRO to design and build original space worthy hardware in India.
With Agnibaan's success, Agnikul Cosmos has set its sights on the future. The company aims to develop a series of rockets with increased payload capacities, catering to the growing demand for low-cost satellite launches. This achievement will lead to further innovation and collaboration within India's space industry, positioning the nation as a major player in the global space race.
